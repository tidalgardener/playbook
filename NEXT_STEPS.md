# Next Steps

Immediate next actions to keep momentum.

## Current status

- Four draft playbooks exist; repo is docs-first and focused on documenting approaches, prompts, and playbooks (no code scaffolds in this phase).

## Next actions (priority order)

1. Capture your baseline “mundane project” definition + workflow and refine the new playbook: `playbooks/genai-assisted-mundane-projects/README.md`.
2. Add copy/pasteable templates for a new project’s canonical doc set + prompt pack (docs-only): `playbooks/genai-assisted-mundane-projects/`.
3. Expand the headless services playbook as one concrete “track” for mundane projects: `playbooks/headless-services-mundane-business-apps/README.md`.
4. Decide whether to add a concrete running example domain (or stay domain-agnostic longer).
5. Decide later whether this repo should ever include MCP/CDK code, or remain documentation-only.

## Known issues / gotchas

- Git commit/push from inside this Codex sandbox may require escalated permissions (see `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`).
