# Recap

High-level progress log for the repository. Keep this brief and durable (major milestones and decisions). Session-by-session details belong in `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

## 2025-12-21

- Bootstrapped repo structure (global docs, playbooks folder, MCP/infra placeholders).
- Added first playbook: headless services for mundane business applications (default AWS: API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB).
- Added “playbook for playbooks” to standardize how we create and iterate on playbooks.
- Added `START_HERE.md` and `DEPLOYING.md` to make onboarding and AWS workflow explicit (CDK still pending).
