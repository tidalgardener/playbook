# TODO: Playbook for Playbooks

## Current status

- This is a new meta playbook; the initial workflow/template is now in place.

- [x] Add a “playbook review” checklist (clarity, completeness, operational realism).
- [x] Add a “prompt pack” template with slots for constraints, guardrails, and output format.
- [x] Add guidance for when to create MCP tooling vs keep it as docs.
- [x] Add guidance for when to deploy to AWS vs keep it local.
- [x] Add examples of good vs bad playbook sections (brief).

## Open questions

- Do we want strict section naming, or “recommended sections” only?
