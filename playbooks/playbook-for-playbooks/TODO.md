# TODO: Playbook for Playbooks

## Current status

- This is a new meta playbook; backlog items below are not started yet.

- [ ] Add a “playbook review” checklist (clarity, completeness, operational realism).
- [ ] Add a “prompt pack” template with slots for constraints, guardrails, and output format.
- [ ] Add guidance for when to create MCP tooling vs keep it as docs.
- [ ] Add guidance for when to deploy to AWS vs keep it local.
- [ ] Add examples of good vs bad playbook sections (brief).

## Open questions

- Do we want strict section naming, or “recommended sections” only?
