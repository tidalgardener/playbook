# TODO: GenAI‑Assisted Mundane Projects

## Current status

- New playbook; needs your workflow captured and translated into repeatable steps.

## P0 (must do next)

- [ ] Capture your “mundane project” definition + workflow (Q&A) and record it in `NOTES.md`.
- [ ] Refine the step-by-step workflow to match your real sequence (remove generic steps that don’t fit).
- [ ] Add a minimal template for “Project Brief” and “ADR” inside `PROMPTS.md` (output formats).

## P1

- [ ] Add a “default doc set” template (recommended filenames + minimal headings) that can be copied into new repos.
- [ ] Add a day‑2 operations checklist (weekly/monthly) for mundane projects.
- [ ] Add prompts for: backlog grooming, release checklist, incident triage, postmortem.

## P2

- [ ] Add optional “tracks” beyond headless services (web app, integration/automation).
- [ ] Add examples (sanitized) of a real project’s doc set evolving over time.

## Open questions (UNCONFIRMED)

- UNCONFIRMED: Default tech stack expectations vs staying stack-agnostic.
- UNCONFIRMED: What tooling you use day-to-day (issue tracker, CI, cloud provider).
