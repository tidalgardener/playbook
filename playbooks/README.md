# Playbooks

Each playbook lives in its own folder under `playbooks/` and is intended to be shareable.

If you’re creating or refactoring playbooks, start with `playbooks/playbook-for-playbooks/`.

## Current status

- Playbooks are early drafts; expect iteration and template refinement.

## Recommended per-playbook files

- `README.md` — the playbook (goal, assumptions, steps, checklists, validation).
- `TODO.md` — playbook-specific backlog.
- `PROMPTS.md` — prompts/templates for agentic workflows.
- `NOTES.md` — scratchpad and decision log (optional).

## Naming

- Use kebab-case folder names.
- Keep names descriptive and stable (links to playbooks should not churn).

## Known limitations / open questions

- Whether to publish playbooks as a static site (GitHub Pages) or keep Markdown-only longer.
